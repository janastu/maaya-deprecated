Many places related to Shaivism can be found here in Hampi. Namely, the foremost is the “Panchalinga” which marks the outskirts for Hampi, where the Lord Virupakasha temple is the center of the area, hence these places are also called as “Hampiya Meregalu “ or “ </span><a><span>Hampiya Gadigalu</span></a><span> “ literally meaning the borders.</span></p><p><span><br /></span></p><p><span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"90.365296\">01:30</span>- <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"141.95118\">02:21</span>    </p><p><span>The five lingas are named, </span><span>Somanatha, jambunatha, kinnaresvara, vanibhadresvara and mulavirupaksha. </span><span>Colossal temple complexes with superior architecture, large mountains in the landscape, can be seen around these five places.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"142.410046\">02:22</span>-<span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"159.869843\">02:39</span>  </p><p><span>This depicts the magnitude and scale of Hampi being a prominent centre for Shaiva Siddhanta(Philosophy of Shiva).

People in Hampi, participate in the week long fair to be a part of the epic wedding, and people who cannot visit the Virupaksha temple, celebrate the marriage rituals at home, like how it is done in the temple.</span></p><p><span><br /></span></p><p><span><span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1148.470835\">19:08</span> - <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1380.29565\">23:00</span> <br /></span></p><p><span><span></span></span></p><p><span>Apart from these, Hampi's Girija Kalyana is found to be cited in a collection of ancient texts from different regions called the “ Sthala puranas “. For example, After losing Sati, Shiva goes into deep meditation (Tapas). Per the ancient texts, it is said that Shiva sat for his meditation in the todays “Moola Virupaksha” temple in </span><span><a>Hemakoota.</a></span></p><p><br /></p><p><span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1380.29565\">23:00</span> -<span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1480.662633\">24:40</span> <br /></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Further, knowing of Shiva's meditation, the demonic forces in the world go crazy, haunting the Seers, not allowing them to perform their duties. All the seers needed help from Shiva, in order to destroy evil. However, all seers and gods know how angry Shiva could get, it could even destroy the Universe. Finally the Seers and gods zero up on Manmatha ( God of Love) and his mate Rathi, and advise them of precautions required, while they should disturb Shiva and get him out of his meditation for the good of the World. Manmatha succeeds in his mission. However, angry Shiva burns him to ashes with his Third eye. And this place of Annihilation of Manmatha, per the ancient texts is today's “Manmatha Kunda” in Hemakoota, this part of the story is quite famous with the folk and theater community, played under the name of “ Manmatha Vijaya” literally meaning win over Manmatha. Similarly, other places like “ Hanumantha Pampa Sarovara”, “Ratnakoota” are related to geographical/topographical evidence for this Story to have occurred in Hampi, and we can also see this documented by Poet Harihara in his work Pampa Mahatme.</span></p><p><span><br /></span></p><p><span><span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1480.662633\">24:40</span> - <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1533.344331\">25:33</span> <br /></span></p><p><span><span></span></span></p><p><span>Harihara was a famous Kannada poet and writer in the 12th century, observing the heritage, culture, folk, temple celebrations and other factors from the ancient texts, he wrote “Girija Kalyana” which is a Champu-Kavya a mixture of prose and poetry. Also, the local folk and other arts like theater have embraced this story and culture, and allowed for it's evolution and existence until this 21st century. The street singers, and folk artists have sung excerpts from Girija Kalyana, passing it over to their new generations, mostly through speech. These stories reflect the local community's cultural coherence.</span></p><p><span><br /></span></p><p><span><span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1533.460808\">25:33</span> - <span class=\"timestamp\" data-timestamp=\"1631.989375\">27:11</span> <br /></span></p><p><span><span></span></span></p><p><span>To conclude, Throughout history of Hampi and it's heritage, we can see the downfall of empires like “Vijayanagara empire”, even societies “Vaishnava Samaaja”, “The Rashtrakoota samaaja”. But still we see excerpts from ancients texts and stories, embedded into common peoples lifestyle, culture and society and thus allowing for everlasting preservation. With further research and study, we find such a close relation to “Girija Kalyana” and to the local societies. Like how Hampi is famously referred to as the Mythical city of “Kishkindha”(City of Apes-from Ramayana), we now can see this place with new light, as region of “Girija Kalyana” too.</span></p><p><br /></p>\n        <p>Quick tips:</p>\n        <p> </p>\n        <p>- <em>Ctrl+I</em> adds <em>italic</em> formatting and <b>Ctrl+B</b> adds <b>bold</b> formatting.</p>\n        <p>- Press ESC to play/pause, and Ctrl+J to insert the current timestamp.</p><p>\n    </p>","media":"HampiGirijaKalyanaStorybyCraju.mp3","media-time":90.289326}
