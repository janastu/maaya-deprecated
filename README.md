## Tasks
[Maaya alpha.01](gk-completed-milestones-alpha.01.md) 
using the dataset from Girija Kalyana.

Now we'll have to do few tasks for A/B Testing for the version.

### Milestone 4 - Consider a new data set, and setup the app.

1. Let's consider the Interview of Chandan Mitra

	a. [Transcript](http://wiki.janastu.org/wiki/.NjY3.MTU) of the interview. This data needs to be prepared to the structure of [transcript edited into valid json](transcript%20edited%20into%20valid%20json.json)

	b. [Audio](https://longemergency.demx.in/assets/audio-new/Chandan%20Mitra%20interview%20with%20Farah%20Yameen.mp3) of the interview

2. JSON-LD for the application needs to be edited in the [file](jsonld.json)

3. Add the JSON ld to the head of the [index.html](maaya-oh/index.html) in the maaya-oh folder

4. Edit the [maaya-oh/transcript.js](maaya-oh/transcript.js) file.

5. open the app via ur local web server, and there shouldn't be any error in the console.

6. The last task would be to edit the [maaya-oh/resources.js](maaya-oh/resources.js) to add relevant visual material.
